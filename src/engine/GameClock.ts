/**
 * The authoritative clock.
 *
 * Ported from hop//beat, where it was written against a webcam rhythm game and
 * proved out on a real click track: it tracked wall time exactly over a whole
 * song, with zero resyncs. Nothing about it was specific to that input method,
 * which is why it arrives here unchanged.
 *
 * The problem this solves: a playback source reports its position far more
 * coarsely than a game needs to read it. An <audio> element updates
 * `currentTime` only every 20–50 ms depending on the browser, so polling it
 * once per frame produces a time that sticks and then jumps. Notes scheduled
 * against a staircase visibly stutter, and judgment inherits the staircase as
 * error.
 *
 * So the clock does two things:
 *
 *   1. SAMPLE the source, and remember the wall-clock instant of that sample.
 *   2. INTERPOLATE forward from that sample using performance.now(), which is
 *      smooth and monotonic.
 *
 * When the interpolation drifts too far from a fresh sample, it resynchronises.
 * The source always wins in the end — interpolation only fills the gaps
 * between the truths it tells.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the DOM or the audio API, so the whole thing is tested
 * against a fake adapter and an injected clock.
